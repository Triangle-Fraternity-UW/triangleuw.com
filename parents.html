                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;First, let me welcome you to the University of Washington! Here you will embark upon a journey full of new experiences, amazing achievements, troubling failures, and, ultimately, personal growth. Second, I’d like to thank you for taking the time to look into Triangle Fraternity, and how it may help you with this monumental journey. My name is Ryan Dulong, a senior majoring in molecular, cell, developmental biology and am the current president of Triangle Fraternity at UW. Triangle is a non-Greek, social fraternity that is exclusive to STEM and Architecture majors. The purpose of Triangle is to develop balanced men who cultivate high moral character, foster lifelong friendships, and live their lives with integrity. We exemplify this at UW by holding our members to the highest standards as well as supporting them with their collegiate goals and aspirations.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As we are all STEM students within Triangle, we understand the many challenges and obstacles that face STEM students through college and beyond. By becoming a part of Triangle, you gain access to upperclassmen that have experience in your desired major, fellow members who you can easily form study groups with, and an entire fraternity of men that can advise you through every obstacle you come across. With Triangle, you can excel in college with a wealth of advice and support you wouldn’t otherwise have as an undergraduate. What’s better is this support continues long after college as well. There are more than 20,000 alumni across the world in similar fields as you that can help you with pursuing your career post graduation. From interview workshops to resume reviews, our membership base is here to help you not only excel at your degree, but also ace your job applications.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This large base comes from a long national Triangle history that’s connected from chapters in Illinois to California. However, it was only just recently, in the fall quarter of 2016, that we founded Triangle here at UW. We established this fraternity on the principle that we could make it different than the fraternities known across the nation committing terrible acts of hazing and assault. We have built this fraternity to ensure that every member has a voice in shaping the organization. Therefore, this means the newest members also have as much of a voice as any other member, guaranteeing that new members are never mistreated. We built it on the foundations of diversity, respect, and understanding through cross-cultural discussion among our diverse membership base. We built it to abolish hazing, excessive drinking, and sexual assault in fraternities by serving as an example of how a fraternity can thrive without these terrible acts. With these principles in our hearts, we have grown steadily, admitting quality men to help us continue building this organization. The UW campus has taken notice, and it has begun to see the positive influence fraternities, even as young and as new as ours, can have in the lives of students.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We continue to exemplify these principles by keeping our members’ welfare as our top priority. Even though we want all of our brothers to excel in everything they do at UW, we first want to make sure they are doing well both mentally and physically. We do not tolerate any form of degrading or harmful acts among brothers. Hazing is against everything we stand for in this fraternity, and it will never become a part of our culture. We also take action to prevent substance abuse and treat mental illness among our members, as these are some of the most serious threats to young men’s lives in college. Brothers are given workshops to teach them to understand, spot, and help brothers with signs of substance abuse and mental illness, so that every brother has the support they need to live a happy and healthy life at UW.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are many factors to consider before joining any organization, and many questions rightfully come to mind. I know I had many questions and concerns myself before joining Triangle. On that note, I encourage you to reach out to me or any of the Triangle members to learn more about Triangle and what we do.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please, feel free to email me at president@triangleuw.com with any questions or concerns you may have. I’d love to talk to you directly about who we are.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thank you so much for your interest in Triangle fraternity and for taking the time to read about what our brotherhood is truly about. I hope you have a wonderful day, and I hope to hear from you soon!<br>
                        <br>Best,<br>
                        <br>Ryan Dulong, President
                        <br>Triangle Fraternity – University of Washington Colony
